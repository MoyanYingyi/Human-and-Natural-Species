            <h2 class="section-title">Wild animals constantly face threats from humans.</h2>
            <p>Today, many wild animals face challenges posed by human activity. the living space of wildlife is reducing since forests are cut down or land is destroyed. Furthermore, excessive hunting decline wildlife populations, seriously disrupting the natural balance. Pollution from factories, plastic waste and chemicals also makes natural environments unsuitable for animals to survive. </p>
            <p>Climate change is another major threat: rising temperatures and extreme weather make it difficult for some species to find food. Polar bears are a classic example: Rising temperatures are melting Arctic glaciers, forcing them to survive on ice floes. Imagine a future where Arctic glaciers melt completely. It won't just be polar bears that will go extinct. The coastlines of every country will shrink, Venice will be underwater, and vast amounts of wildlife habitat will be destroyed. </p>
            <p>All of these make survival for wildlife more difficult every year. Even simple actions like reducing waste, protecting natural areas can make a change for the wildlife.</p>
